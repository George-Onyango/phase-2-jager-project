# Student Enlist APPLICATION

## Introduction
 Students normally leave out very crucial information when signing to school. This application will solve that, it clearly out lines the fields that a student should fill for easy tracing and even grading marks

## Project Description
This is a React project to help lecturers easily identify a student in his/her course and award marks accordingly to the mark attained. Also the lecturer is able to reach individual student in case of an issue.

## Usage
`
mkdir jager
git clone git@github.com:George-Onyango/phase-2-jager-project.git
cd project
run npm install
run npm start

`

## MVP
1. SignIn page
2. Home page where already created student will show on search of the specific student created
3. Create student page that allows user create a profile
4. SignOut page

## User stories
1. A user I should be able to sign in to the application
2. As a user I should be able to search for a student in home page. If I already craeted one, I should see it displayed on the home page. Otherwise, I should be notified to create one first.
3. As a user, I should be able to create my student porfolio on the Create Student page.
4. As a user, I should be able sign out of the application.

## Remarks 
- This is not my finest work but I will work on progressively adding and improving on it further.
